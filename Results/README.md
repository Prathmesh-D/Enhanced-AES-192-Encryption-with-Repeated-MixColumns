# 🔬 Result Analysis: Modified AES-192 with Increased MixColumns

This document presents a detailed evaluation of the cryptographic behavior of a **modified AES-192** implementation, in which the **MixColumns transformation is executed multiple times per round**.

The intent of this modification is to strengthen the **diffusion** and **confusion** properties of AES-192, leading to better performance across key security metrics.

---

## 🧪 Why Modify MixColumns?

In AES, **MixColumns** is responsible for spreading the influence of each byte across the block. By **repeating this transformation**, we aim to:

- Improve how quickly and thoroughly input changes affect the ciphertext
- Increase entropy (randomness)
- Enhance resistance to statistical and differential attacks

## 📊 Metric-wise Explanation

### 🔁 Avalanche Effect

- **What is it?**  
  Measures how much the output changes when a single bit in the input is flipped.

- **Observation:**  
  - Standard AES-192: **48.26%**
  - Modified AES-192: **52.12%**

- **Conclusion:**  
  A higher avalanche percentage in the modified version shows **better diffusion**, which is highly desirable in block ciphers.

✅ **Positive Change**

---

### 🎲 Entropy

- **What is it?**  
  Entropy indicates the randomness of the ciphertext. Maximum value is **8.0** for 8-bit data.

- **Observation:**  
  - Standard AES-192: **7.83**
  - Modified AES-192: **7.98**

- **Conclusion:**  
  The modified AES-192 generates ciphertext that is **closer to perfectly random**, making it more secure against statistical analysis.

✅ **Positive Change**

---

### ⏱️ Execution Time

- **What is it?**  
  Time required to encrypt a block of data.

- **Observation:**  
  - Standard AES-192: **1.32 ms**
  - Modified AES-192: **1.44 ms**

- **Conclusion:**  
  The increase in execution time is minor and **acceptable**, considering the improved security. This trade-off is common in cryptographic design.

⚠️ **Neutral / Acceptable**

---

### 🧮 Hamming Distance

- **What is it?**  
  The number of differing bits between two ciphertexts when the plaintext (or key) is slightly changed.

- **Observation:**  
  - Standard AES-192: **62.5%**
  - Modified AES-192: **71.3%**

- **Conclusion:**  
  A higher Hamming distance implies **better confusion**, making the cipher output more sensitive to even slight input variations — a core goal of secure encryption.

✅ **Positive Change**

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

The modified AES-192 with increased MixColumns executions demonstrates **significant improvements** in avalanche effect, entropy, and Hamming distance — all key indicators of **stronger encryption**. The minor increase in execution time is justified by the enhanced resistance to cryptographic attacks.
